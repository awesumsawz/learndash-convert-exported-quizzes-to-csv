# learndash-convert-exported-quizzes-to-csv
Learndash allows users to export their quiz data to an XML document. However, if you need to get these quizzes output to human-readable form, it's a little overwhelming in XML format. To solve this, I built out a python script that converts the XML into a CSV which is organized by "Quiz Name", "Question", "Answer", and "Is Correct".
